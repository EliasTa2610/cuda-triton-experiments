    OPT   This workload exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak           
          performance of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak           
          typically indicate latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential       
          reasons.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 2.0 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 13.30 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 2.90 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible      
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices
